# This is the user configuration file for myth2kodi. It should be placed in
# the myth2kodi working directory (typically: /home/<username>/.myth2kodi).
# See the 'm2kdir' user setting found in the myth2kodi script, NB 'm2kdir'
# cannot be set in this configuration file but must be set correctly in the
# myth2kodi script -- as it is used to find the myth2kodi.conf file.
#
# This file is 'source'd after default values are set in the script and so can
# be used to override those defaults. For any default values you wish to
# override, simply uncomment the variable below and modify its value to suit
# your needs.
#
# It is important to check that the values of paramaters flagged with:
#   '#<------THIS VALUE MUST BE SET-------'

############################ Processing settings #############################

# PROCESS_RECORDING_MODE has 2 modes. 'MOVE'(DEFAULT)|'LINK':
# 'MOVE' -- Move the recording. And, by default: create a symlink at InputPath;
# 'LINK' -- Do not move, just create a sym'LINK';
#PROCESS_RECORDING_MODE='MOVE'

#A modifier switch, relevant for PROCESS_RECORDING_MODE='MOVE'. With this
#setting 'Enabled' a link is created from the original MythTV recording file
#location to the file just moved into your Kodi library. This enables MythTV
#to continue tracking and maintain control of the recording.
#Options: ['Enabled'(DEFAULT)|'Disabled']
#WARNING: 'Disabled' Mode removes MythTV-DB entry, SO CANNOT BE UNDONE.
#SYMLINK='Enabled'

#If TargetPathIsInputPath is Enabled, original dir will override MoveDir. This
#is useful for multiple recording dirs. TargetPathIsInputPath will separate
#generic shows from episodes and movies. Options: ['Enabled'|'Disabled'(DEFAULT)]
#TargetPathIsInputPath='Disabled'

#ShowStopper prevents generic shows and unrecognised episodes from being
#processed. Options: ['Enabled'(DEFAULT)|'Disabled']
#ShowStopper='Enabled'

#DIR_TRACKING_CLEANUP will check for and remove the folders created by myth2kodi
#Options: ['Enabled'(DEFAULT)|'Disabled']
#DIR_TRACKING_CLEANUP='Enabled'

#FailSafe mode will enable symlinks to be formed in FailSafeDir if the move or
#symlink operation fails. Options: Enabled|Disabled
#FailSafeMode='Disabled'

#The following four settings can Enable or Disable the mechanisms used used for
#identifying an episode. By default they are all 'Enabled' and should generally
#be left that way. Identification is done by comparing the data extracted from
#your MythTV-DB and provided at the command line against data downloaded from
#TheTVBD and TVmaze.

#MATCH_SEASON_EPISODE can be used to enable/disable attempting episode identification
#based on the season and episode numbers. The mechanism is an exact match against
#the "season" and "episode" field from the Guide data in MythTV-DB against the
#"airedSeason" and "airedEpisodeNumber"(TheTVDB) & "season" and "number"(tvmaze)
#fields for the series.
#Options: ['Enabled'(DEFAULT)|'Disabled']
#MATCH_SEASON_EPISODE='Enabled'

#MATCH_SUBTITLE can be used to enable/disable attempting episode identification
#based on the episode title. The mechanism first tries an exact match using grep,
#failing that it then uses agrep to "fuzzy" match the "subtitle" field from the
#Guide data in MythTV-DB against the "episodeName"(TheTVDB) and "name"(tvmaze)
#fields for the series.
#Options: ['Enabled'(DEFAULT)|'Disabled']
#MATCH_SUBTITLE='Enabled'

#MATCH_ORIGINALAIRDATE can be used to enable/disable attempting episode identification
#based on the original airdate for the episode. The mechanism tries an exact match
#of the "originalairdate" field from the Guide data in MythTV-DB against the
#"firstAired"(TheTVDB) and "airdate"(tvmaze) fields for the series.
#Options: ['Enabled'(DEFAULT)|'Disabled']
#MATCH_ORIGINALAIRDATE='Enabled'

#MATCH_PLOT can be used to enable/disable attempting episode identification
#based on the episode plot. The mechanism uses agrep to fuzzy match the
#"description" field from the Guide data in MythTV-DB against the overview(TheTVDB)
#and summary(tvmaze) data for the series.
#Options: ['Enabled'(DEFAULT)|'Disabled']
#MATCH_PLOT='Enabled'

#StorageGroupFallback can enable/disable a bit of code that, if Guide Data
#identified the input file as a show or episode, but no episode or series
#information was found, then it checks if the MythTV DB's storagegroup is
#movie[s] or film[s] and uses this to reset the recording type as Movie.
#To function it requires that you have created a MythTV storagegroup called
#something like 'Movies' and selected that storagegroup when making the rule
#for the recording. This works for my setup -- SAK.
#Options: ['Enabled'|'Disabled'(DEFAULT)]
#StorageGroupFallback='Disabled'

#CommercialMarkup will generate comskip files for recordings when they are moved.
#Options: ['Enabled'(DEFAULT)|'Disabled']
#CommercialMarkup='Enabled'

#CommercialMarkupCleanup if "Enabled", when m2k_maintenance() is run, removes
#comskip & NFO files if the associated .mpg file cannot be found.
#Options: ['Enabled'(DEFAULT)|'Disabled']
#CommercialMarkupCleanup='Enabled'

#Whether to track files and directories created by myth2kodi. This should always
#be 'Enabled' when performing ordinary processing to make MythTV recordings
#available to a Kodi library. It exists so we don't mess-up the tracking of
#myth2kodi's modifications to our Kodi library when we want to use myth2kodi
#with PROCESS_RECORDING_MODE='COPY' to put nicely named copies of our MythTV
#recordings on a removable media. See, 'example_copy_to_removable_media_myth2kodi.conf'.
#Options: ['Enabled'(DEFAULT)|'Disabled']
#TRACKING='Enabled'

#A string to append to the "ShowFileName" before the suffix. Useful if you want
#to easily distinguish between recordings moved by myth2kodi and other media.
#For example, setting SHOW_FILE_NAME_APPEND=' - MYTH2KODI' will produce a
#processed recording name like 'ShowName S01E01 (EpisodeSubtitle) - MYTH2KODI.mpg'
#rather than the default which is like 'ShowName S01E01 (EpisodeSubtitle).mpg'.
#Default: ''
#SHOW_FILE_NAME_APPEND=''

#There are some checks in the script that prevent reprocessing a recording that
#we have already processed. Enabling this option skips those checks.
#Options: ['Enabled'|'Disabled'(DEFAULT)]
#FORCE_PROCESS='Disabled'


############################# Directory Settings #############################

#The directory where myth2kodi writes its temporary files, Default='/tmp'
#Typically, /tmp is tmpfs and so avoids unnecessary writes to disk. If you're
#on Linux and /tmp isn't tmpfs but you would rather avoid writing to disk then
#/dev/shm is guaranteed to be tmpfs. Alternatively, if you're short on RAM but
#don't mind some extra disk writes then use "$m2kdir". NOTE: When running with
#LOGLEVEL>=3, there are a number of temporary files that aren't automatically
#deleted, they will, however, be cleared as part of: myth2kodi --maintenance
#M2K_TMPDIR='/tmp'

#MoveDir is the folder which myth2kodi will move the file. No trailing / is
#accepted eg. "$HOME/videos"
#MoveDir='/media/video/tv'                    #<------THIS VALUE MUST BE SET-------

#AlternateMoveDir will act as a secondary MoveDir if the primary MoveDir fails.
#No trailing / is accepted eg. "$HOME/videos"
#AlternateMoveDir="$HOME/recordedTV"

#Primary Movie Dir. myth2kodi will attempt to move to this dir first. No
#trailing / is accepted eg. "$HOME/videos"
#PrimaryMovieDir='/media/video/movies'        #<------THIS VALUE MUST BE SET-------

#AlternateMovieDir is a fallback move dir if the primary movie dir fails.
#AlternateMovieDir="$HOME/recordedMovies"

#Primary Show Dir. myth2kodi will attempt to move to this dir first. No
#trailing / is accepted eg. "$HOME/videos"
#PrimaryShowDir='/media/video/recordedShows'  #<------THIS VALUE MUST BE SET-------

#AlternateMoveDir is a fallback move dir if the primary move dir fails
#AlternateShowDir="$HOME/recordedShows"

#FailSafeDir is used when the file cannot be moved to the MoveDir. FailSafe
#will not create folders. eg. /home/username
#FailSafeDir="$HOME/FailSafe"                 #<------THIS VALUE MUST BE SET-------
