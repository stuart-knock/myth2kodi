#
#Software the way it should be: Free and Open Source
#

#Intention:
#  This program automates the mapping of MythTV recordings to a Kodi library.
#  It is designed to be a user job in MythTV. It can also be run manually from
#  a command line. It must have access to your MythTV recordings. The program
#  generates file names compatible with Kodi, then moves or links recordings
#  based on user settings. Comskip and NFO files are also generated from your
#  MythTV database, as required, so that Kodi can make use of them.
#
#Installation:
#  There is an install.sh script that supports local and system installs.
#  If you would prefer manual installation it is fairly straight-forward.
#  The myth2kodi file should be placed in the users path, see the binpath
#  variable in user settings (Default: /usr/local/bin). Some of the
#  functionality of this script is provided in other files, these will also
#  need to be placed in $binpath along with this script. They are:
#  mythdb_access -- Uses MythTV python bindings to access database information.
#  m2k_notify -- A script for sending notifications to Gnome Desktop.
#  bashlogging -- A set of bash functions that provide the logging mechanism
#                 used throughout myth2kodi.
#
#Usage:
#  To function on your system, some of the variables specified in the
#  USER SETTINGS section below may need to be modified from their defaults.
#  For example, to avoid permission issues, myth2kodi should be run as the
#  same user running MythTV (see USER SETTING, Librarian), or at the very
#  least a user permitted to read and write the recording files generated
#  by MythTV.
#  The MythTV user job should be called as follows:
#    $binpath/myth2kodi "%DIR%/%FILE%"
#  where "$binpath" is replaced by the full explicit path from USER SETTINGS.
#  At the command line, the script can be called with the following form:
#    myth2kodi "Input File" "show name" "episode name" "season-number" "episode-number"
#  for example:
#    myth2kodi "/home/myth/recordings/2308320472023429837.mpg" "South Park" "Here Comes the Neighborhood"
#  for additional functionality type:
#    myth2kodi --help
#
#Output-target:
#  If an error occurs and the file cannot be moved, then no change will occur to
#  the original file. If the MoveDir is full or not available, such as when
#  running a NAS and the computer is disconnected from the network, the
#  AlternateMoveDir will be used. If both of these dirs fail, the show will be
#  SymLinked in the FailSafeDir. You may elect to run the user job at a later
#  time when the issue has been resolved. Output dir and link type will depend
#  on user settings. The file name is preset to the most acceptable standard:
#    Show Title - SxxExx (Episode Title).ext
#
#Symlinking:
#  In MOVE mode, with SYMLINKing Enabled, myth2kodi will create a symbolic
#  link to the new file (in your Kodi library directory) with the same name and
#  location of the original file (The MythTV recordings directory). In LINK mode,
#  myth2kodi will not move the recording file, LINK mode creates a new symbolic
#  link to the original file. Both approaches enable Kodi to access the recording
#  while still allowing MythTV to keep track of it. In MOVE mode, with
#  SYMLINKing Disabled, after a successful move, myth2kodi will delete the
#  recording from MythTV's database -- MythTV can no longer track/control
#  recordings processed in this mode, and myth2kodi cannot undo them.
#
#Output-Files:
#  myth2kodi will create several files in its working folder. This is a
#  list of the files and their functions:
#    +created.tracking keeps track of created comskip.txt and NFO files so they
#      can be deleted in the future if their video file is deleted.
#    +doover.sh is designed to keep track of failed jobs. It is designed to be
#      executable. #Commented commands are those which are determined to be
#      questionable. This file can be made executable and run after a problem is
#      corrected which caused the problem. Questionable commands are those which
#      will require you to add an episode title and set the myth2kodi
#      Database=Disabled setting. Questionable files do not have sufficient
#      guide data.
#    +markupstart.txt and markupstop.txt are files which contain information
#      from the last comskip generation. Deletion will cause no adverse effects.
#    +myth2kodi.log keeps track of operations and can be used to determine problems.
#    +shn.txt, sid.txt, and working.xml are used each time to determine the name
#      and show id of the last show identified.
#    +DailyReport directory is used to log the files which were moved that day.
#      It can be used as a "program guide" of sorts to keep track of what has
#      been added to your library.
#
#Logging:
#  Log files can be generated to show information for troubleshooting. You can
#  find the log file in myth2kodi's working folder (see USER SETTING, m2kdir).
#  For configuration options, see, the "Logging settings" section of
#  USER SETTINGS below. The default location of the main log file is:
#    /home/$Librarian/.myth2kodi/myth2kodi.log
#
#Database-external:
#  This program will make 3 calls to TheTVDB for every episode. The first one is
#  to obtain the series ID and verify the show name is correct. The second is to
#  check if the internally managed database is up-to-date. The third call will
#  only be made if the internal database is not up-to-date. The third call will
#  download a larger file which contains all information about the show which is
#  known on TheTVDB.
#
#Database-internal:
#  While myth2kodi maintains and requires its own external file/folder
#  database in the working directory, there is also support for integration with
#  MythTV's internal database. MythTV Database is required for movies to be
#  recognized and handled by myth2kodi. Also, in the event that the
#  integrated fuzzy logic cannot make a determination of the correct show name,
#  myth2kodi will pull the original air date from the MythTV database
#  and attempt to make an exact match to TheTVDB.com supplied data. In addition,
#  the type of program is extracted from the mythtv database and a determination
#  is made weather or not there is sufficient information available to identify
#  the show based upon guide data. In order to make myth2kodi work to
#  its full potential, all settings must be filled out correctly under the
#  database section of the user settings. Currently, the only guide data
#  supported is schedulesdirect through mythtv. When updating myth2kodi
#  it is best to delete all database folders to ensure proper data formatting.
#
#Dependencies:
#  "curl" -- downloads webpages and sends commands to Kodi;
#  "jq" -- parses json files, used for tvmaze data.
#  "agrep" -- provides fuzzy string matching;
#  "libnotify-bin" -- allows GNOME desktop notifications;
#  "mythbackend" -- Access the MythTV database.
#
#  These should all be available through the package manager for your Linux
#  distribution. For example:
#    "apt-get install curl"
#  or
#    "zypper install curl"
#
#  Logging in myth2kodi relies on a script called:
#    "bashlogging"
#  if you downloaded a release, then, this should be included in the tarball.
#  Otherwise it can be found at:
#    https://github.com/stuart-knock/bash-tools
#
#Gnome Notifications:
#  In order for myth2kodi to send notifications to the GNOME desktop, it
#  must have no-password sudo access. It uses this access strictly to send
#  complete, moving and failure status notifications. Because this program is
#  launched by the user $Librarian under normal circumstances, $Librarian must
#  temporarily become your user name in order to send a notification to your
#  desktop. This requires the use of a separate script, and for $Librarian to
#  have a sudoers group with no password option. Notifications are an optional
#  feature and will only work on the MythTV backend computer. The m2k_notify
#  script should be located in $binpath.
#
#KODI Notifications:
#   If enabled, myth2kodi will send a http requests to any specified KODI
#   servers to display library updates, to update the library and to clean out
#   the library. In order for this to work KODI you must ensure that the
#   setting in KODI under System->Network->Services->Allow control of KODI via
#   HTTP and Allow programs on other systems to control KODI are enabled.
#
#Show Name Translation:
#  The user may elect to create a file in the myth2kodi working folder which
#  will then translate any recorded show name into the desired show name.
#  This is useful for adding a year to distinguish between a new series and an
#  older series and/or typos in your guide data. By default it should be called
#  "showTranslations" and it will be in your $m2kdir folder. Correct show titles
#  can be determined by manually searching www.TheTVDB.com. The showTranslations
#  file is not needed by most SchedulesDirect users and the file should only be
#  created if it is needed. However, it is almost essential when using digital
#  free to air guide data, such as SydFTA (See USER SETTING, "GuideDataType").
#  An example file, "showTranslations.SydFTA", should be bundled with this script.
#  The format of showTranslations is (NB: no "#" or space at the start of a
#  line, only one space either side of "=", and no trailing space or any other
#  characters):
#    Filename: $m2kdir/showTranslations
#      My Guide Show Title = www.TheTVDB.com Show Title
#      Battlestar Gallactica = Battlestar Gallactica (2003)
#      The Office = The Office (US)
#      Millionaire = Who Wants To Be A Millionaire
#      Aqua teen Hungerforce = Aqua Teen Hunger Force

############################ Processing settings #############################

# There are 3 modes for the processing of a recording:
#   'MOVE' -- Move the recording. And, by default: create a symlink at RECORDING_PATH;
#   'LINK' -- Do not move, just create a symbolic 'LINK'; and
#   'COPY' -- Copy the recording to the target location.
#NOTE: The 'COPY' mode is primarily meant for supporting the copying of MythTV
#      recording files to removable media with nice human readable file names.
#      It is not yet intended or tested as a mode for generating a local Kodi
#      library. See, 'example_copy_to_removable_media_myth2kodi.conf' for an
#      example of temporarily enabling 'COPY' mode for this purpose.
#Options: ['MOVE'(DEFAULT)|'LINK'|'COPY']
PROCESS_RECORDING_MODE='MOVE'

#A modifier switch, relevant for PROCESS_RECORDING_MODE='MOVE'. With this
#setting 'Enabled' a link is created from the original MythTV recording file
#location to the file just moved into your Kodi library. This enables MythTV
#to continue tracking and maintain control of the recording.
#Options: ['Enabled'(DEFAULT)|'Disabled']
#WARNING: 'Disabled' Mode removes MythTV-DB entry, SO CANNOT BE UNDONE.
SYMLINK='Enabled'

#If TargetPathIsInputPath is Enabled, original dir will override MoveDir. This
#is useful for multiple recording dirs. TargetPathIsInputPath will separate
#generic shows from episodes and movies. Options: ['Enabled'|'Disabled'(DEFAULT)]
TargetPathIsInputPath='Disabled'

#ShowStopper prevents generic shows from being processed. Generic shows are
#those recordings that have not been identified as either a movie or an episode
#of a tv-series (more specifically, continuing shows with entries in TheTVDB).
#This typically means news or sporting events.
#Options: ['Enabled'(DEFAULT)|'Disabled']
ShowStopper='Enabled'

#DIR_TRACKING_CLEANUP will check for and remove the folders created by myth2kodi
#Options: ['Enabled'(DEFAULT)|'Disabled']
DIR_TRACKING_CLEANUP='Enabled'

#FailSafe mode will enable symlinks to be formed in FailSafeDir if the move or
#symlink operation fails. Options: Enabled|Disabled
FailSafeMode='Disabled'

#The following four settings can Enable or Disable the mechanisms used used for
#identifying an episode. By default they are all 'Enabled' and should generally
#be left that way. Identification is done by comparing the data extracted from
#your MythTV-DB and provided at the command line against data downloaded from
#TheTVBD and TVmaze.

#MATCH_SEASON_EPISODE can be used to enable/disable attempting episode identification
#based on the season and episode numbers. The mechanism is an exact match against
#the "season" and "episode" field from the Guide data in MythTV-DB against the
#"airedSeason" and "airedEpisodeNumber"(TheTVDB) & "season" and "number"(tvmaze)
#fields for the series.
#Options: ['Enabled'(DEFAULT)|'Disabled']
MATCH_SEASON_EPISODE='Enabled'

#MATCH_SUBTITLE can be used to enable/disable attempting episode identification
#based on the episode title. The mechanism first tries an exact match using grep,
#failing that it then uses agrep to "fuzzy" match the "subtitle" field from the
#Guide data in MythTV-DB against the "episodeName"(TheTVDB) and "name"(tvmaze)
#fields for the series.
#Options: ['Enabled'(DEFAULT)|'Disabled']
MATCH_SUBTITLE='Enabled'

#MATCH_ORIGINALAIRDATE can be used to enable/disable attempting episode identification
#based on the original airdate for the episode. The mechanism tries an exact match
#of the "originalairdate" field from the Guide data in MythTV-DB against the
#"firstAired"(TheTVDB) and "airdate"(tvmaze) fields for the series.
#Options: ['Enabled'(DEFAULT)|'Disabled']
MATCH_ORIGINALAIRDATE='Enabled'

#MATCH_PLOT can be used to enable/disable attempting episode identification
#based on the episode plot. The mechanism uses agrep to fuzzy match the
#"description" field from the Guide data in MythTV-DB against the overview(TheTVDB)
#and summary(tvmaze) data for the series.
#Options: ['Enabled'(DEFAULT)|'Disabled']
MATCH_PLOT='Enabled'

#StorageGroupFallback can enable/disable a bit of code that, if Guide Data
#identified the input file as a show or episode, but no episode or series
#information was found, then it checks if the MythTV-DB's storagegroup is
#movie[s] or film[s] and uses this to reset the recording type as Movie.
#To function it requires that you have created a MythTV storagegroup called
#something like 'Movies' and selected that storagegroup when making the rule
#for the recording. This works for my setup SAK.
#Options: ['Enabled'|'Disabled'(DEFAULT)]
StorageGroupFallback='Disabled'

#CommercialMarkup will generate comskip files for recordings when they are moved.
#Options: ['Enabled'(DEFAULT)|'Disabled']
CommercialMarkup='Enabled'

#CommercialMarkupCleanup if 'Enabled', when m2k_maintenance() is run, removes
#comskip & NFO files if the associated .mpg file cannot be found.
#Options: ['Enabled'(DEFAULT)|'Disabled']
CommercialMarkupCleanup='Enabled'

#Whether to track files and directories created by myth2kodi. This should always
#be 'Enabled' when performing ordinary processing to make MythTV recordings
#available to a Kodi library. It exists so we do not mess-up the tracking of
#myth2kodi's modifications to our Kodi library when we want to use myth2kodi
#with PROCESS_RECORDING_MODE='COPY' to put nicely named copies of our MythTV
#recordings on a removable media. See, 'example_copy_to_removable_media_myth2kodi.conf'.
#It's also automatically set to 'Disabled' if you process a non-MyhtTV recording.
#Options: ['Enabled'(DEFAULT)|'Disabled']
TRACKING='Enabled'

#A string to append to the "ShowFileName" before the suffix. Useful if you want
#to easily distinguish between recordings moved by myth2kodi and other media.
#For example, setting SHOW_FILE_NAME_APPEND=' - MYTH2KODI' will produce a
#processed recording name like 'TITLE S01E01 (SUBTITLE) - MYTH2KODI.mpg'
#rather than the default which is like 'TITLE S01E01 (SUBTITLE).mpg'.
#Default: ''
SHOW_FILE_NAME_APPEND=''

# GROUP_BY_RECGROUP can be used to enable/disable grouping of processed
# recordings by MythTV's recgroup property. When 'Enabled' the resulting target
# path is of the form: "$MoveDir/<recgroup>/ShowName/Season ..."; as opposed to
# the default('Disabled'): "$MoveDir/ShowName/Season ..."
#Options: ['Enabled'|'Disabled'(DEFAULT)]
GROUP_BY_RECGROUP='Disabled'

#There are some checks in the script that prevent reprocessing a recording that
#we have already processed. Enabling this option skips those checks.
#Options: ['Enabled'|'Disabled'(DEFAULT)]
FORCE_PROCESS='Disabled'

#The default version of agrep varies between distributions, with different
#versions recognising different flags/options. While myth2kodi tries to use an
#option set that works across as many variants as possible it can still have
#difficulty with the default agrep of some distributions. If agrep produces
#error messages when running myth2kodi, you can set an explicit path to a
#different version of agrep using this user-setting. For example, tre-agrep
#should work and is available as an alternative on most distributions.

#TODO: REALLY NEED TO REVIEW sudo USE AND PERMISSIONS EXPECTATIONS WITHIN THE SCRIPT...

#TODO: If we just prepend $binpath to $Librarian's path we could avoid all the
#      explicit paths in our function calls... Though we may need to clean up before we finished...
#          SCRIPTPATH="$( cd "$(dirname "$0")" ; pwd -P )"

#TODO: Check all deletion or other reference of ' ' and consider whether it
#      would be better to use the more inclusive [[:blank:]] or [[:space:]]...

#TODO: review issues caused by multiple simultaneous instances, eg log file
#      needs to be locked to prevent deleting by subsequent call that triggers
#      logrotate... maybe GUID log files on a per-call basis???

#
#TODO: ?Would it be neater to just have undo and doover as lists of MythTV
#      recording file names, then just have functions to process them???
